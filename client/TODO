Missing:
- fetching accounts
- updating an access
- manually adding an operation.
- everything related to alerts.

general todo:
- move currentAccessId/currentAccountId to the banks ducks.

(being done) Once everything is moved to the react/react-redux design:
- put all actions into a single store file.
- make helpers from the top state to the useful information.
- ensure map{State,Dispatch}ToProps are not using private fields of state.
